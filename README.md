# SolveTriangles
Solution for the triangle challenge

This program determines the type of triangle based on the lengths of the sides of the triangle given as inputs.

If the lengths of all the sides of the triangle are equal, it classifies it as an equilateral triangle.
If the lengths of ony two sides of the triangle are equal, it classifies it as an isosceles triangle.
If the lengths of all the sides of the triangle are not equal, it classifies it as a scalene traingle.

The program does not take zero or negative numbers as inputs. It gives the user another chance to provide the right form of input.
Also, the program also considers decimal numbers as inputs.

Try-catch blocks are included for catching exceptions like character inputs and other types of errors.
